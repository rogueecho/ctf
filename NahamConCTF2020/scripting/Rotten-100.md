1. Connecting to the provided port gives you some instructions followed by garbled text.

```
kali@kali:~/ctf/NahamConCTF2020/scripting$ nc jh2i.com 50034
send back this line exactly. no flag here, just filler.

```

2. Notice how none of the punctuation is garbled, just the letters. This is an indicator that it is a simple Caesar cipher. [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef) has a great tool for solving these.
Select the ROT13 recipe and adjust the key as needed, then send the produced decoded phrase back.

3. Eventually you will get enough clues to piece together the flag.

TODO: This is easily done automagically with a little python. I was pretty tired and it was nearing the end of the CTF so I'll write up a script later and include it here.
