1. If you connect in to the provided shell you get a TON of traffic back, some printable some not. `nc jh2i.com 50017`

2. Filter out the incoming data because you only want the flag

Note: `strings` is probably not needed here but I threw it in for shits and giggles.

`nc jh2i.com 50017 | strings | grep flag`

3. Wait a few minutes and the flag will pop up.

Flag: flag{more_text_in_the_vortex}
